# spa pet-book-random

### 

### It`s a spa application with authentication in firebase. 
You are create your book list`s, tag`s, genre and select those you want see of the random. At least that's how it should have been.
### I don`t finished it is app and i am not know when i am continue write code.
Here even there is no adaptive of the loyaut.

I loaded it is a spa for watching code.
Here i am use vue 2, vuex, vue-router, tailwind, firebase, scss. 

P.S Initially, I thought of making a sheet out of this, but at some point everything changed and it became what you see on the screenshots)
